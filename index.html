<section id="why-prep">
  <h2>Why preparation matters</h2>
  <p>Many property sales fall behind schedule due to missing documents, unreported issues, or delayed communication between parties. Proper preparation can mean the difference between a fast, smooth sale and extended negotiations or contract withdrawals.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    A professional conveyancing team such as  
    <a href="https://www.firstclasslegal.com.au/services/conveyancing/selling-residential-property/" target="_blank">First Class Legal</a>  
    helps ensure the legal side of selling is handled correctly from day one.
  </div>
</section>


<section id="legal">
  <h2>Legal documents required before selling</h2>
  <p>Before your property can be marketed, certain legal documents must be prepared to comply with state property law and ensure buyers are fully informed.</p>

  <h3>Common documents include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Current Certificate of Title</li>
    <li>Local council certificates</li>
    <li>Water authority statements</li>
    <li>Zoning and planning information</li>
    <li>Mortgage details and discharge forms</li>
    <li>Owners corporation documentation (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Building permits and compliance certificates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your conveyancer typically handles these preparations so that all requirements are met before the property is listed.</p>
</section>


<section id="disclosure">
  <h2>Understanding vendor disclosure obligations</h2>
  <p>Sellers are legally required to disclose certain information to buyers. The goal is to ensure transparency and protect both sides of the transaction.</p>

  <h3>Examples of required disclosures:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Restrictions or encumbrances on the title</li>
    <li>Easements or rights of way</li>
    <li>Information about renovations or extensions</li>
    <li>Any notices issued by the local council</li>
    <li>Outstanding fees related to the property</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Failure to disclose accurately can give the buyer grounds to withdraw from the contract, even late in the process. This is why professional oversight is strongly recommended.</p>
</section>


<section id="marketing">
  <h2>Preparing your home for the market</h2>
  <p>Once your legal documents are underway, it’s time to prepare the physical property. This ensures your home attracts strong buyer interest from the moment it hits the market.</p>

  <h3>Key preparation steps:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Declutter and clean all living areas</li>
    <li>Carry out small repairs (door handles, paint touch-ups, fixtures)</li>
    <li>Enhance curb appeal (gardens, pathways, pressure washing)</li>
    <li>Stage rooms to create flow and spaciousness</li>
    <li>Use professional photography</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Presentation plays a major role in first impressions and can significantly impact the final sale price.</p>

<section id="offers">
  <h2>Reviewing offers and contract terms</h2>
  <p>When offers begin to arrive, the terms are just as important as the price. Conditions, settlement time frames, and the buyer’s financial readiness all affect how smoothly the sale proceeds.</p>

  <h3>Key elements to consider:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Deposit amount</li>
    <li>Settlement period</li>
    <li>Special conditions requested by the buyer</li>
    <li>Whether the offer is subject to finance or inspections</li>

<section id="settlement-prep">
  <h2>Preparing for settlement</h2>
  <p>Settlement marks the final stage of the sale. Before this date arrives, a number of steps must be completed to ensure everything proceeds smoothly.</p>

  <h3>Seller obligations before settlement:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Authorising loan discharge with your bank</li>
    <li>Reviewing the statement of adjustments</li>
    <li>Signing transfer documents</li>
    <li>Ensuring the property is in the same condition as at inspection</li>
    <li>Confirming key handover arrangements with the agent</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="final">
  <h2>Final steps before handing over the keys</h2>
  <p>In the final days before settlement, your conveyancer confirms all financial and legal processes are ready, including title transfer and communication with all parties. Once settlement is completed, the agent receives confirmation to release keys to the buyer.</p>

  <p>A smooth handover leaves a positive experience for both seller and buyer, closing the chapter on your property with confidence and certainty.</p>
